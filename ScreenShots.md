**Expense Entry Form:**
The Expense Entry Form is the user interface of the Expense Management System. Users can use this form to enter new expense records into the system. The form contains various controls, including date selection, category and expense name dropdowns, amount and comment textboxes, and a listbox to view existing expense records. Users can edit, update, filter, search, and delete records directly from this form. Additionally, the form allows users to export all data to a new Excel file and import data from other Excel spreadsheets with related fields.

**Dashboard:**
The Dashboard provides a visual overview of expense information using various charts and shapes. Key insights include the overall expense value, average daily expense, largest expense category, most recurring expense, and a comparison of previous year's expenses with the current year. The dashboard uses different chart types, such as donut charts, line charts, and waterfall charts, to highlight expense trends and comparisons. The battery chart provides a quick summary of expense distribution across different categories, and slicing the battery chart shows percentage distribution within each category.

**Analysis - Pivot Table:**
The Analysis page includes a pivot table that displays the total value of expenses grouped by category and expense name. The pivot table provides a comprehensive view of expense data, allowing users to analyze expenses based on different criteria, such as category and expense name.

**System Admin:**
The System Admin page is dedicated to administrative tasks. It includes buttons for changing passwords, managing permissions, and adjusting system settings. Admins can update user credentials, restrict user access to sensitive information (e.g., Analysis page and Dashboard), and customize the system's background color and Excel menus.

**Interface:**
The Interface page contains essential company information, such as address, email, website, and phone number. It also lists the departments within the organization for which expenses will be covered (e.g., Clinic, Laboratory, Inpatient). The Interface page provides quick access to other sections of the system, including the Expense Entry Form and the Database (spreadsheet). It serves as the central hub for navigating through different parts of the application.

**Combobox Sheet - Dependent Dropdowns:**
The Combobox sheet is a critical helper sheet that enables the functionality of dependent dropdowns in the Expense Entry Form. It contains headers for all expense categories, and each row represents the respective expense names related to the corresponding category. The dependent dropdowns in the userform use this sheet to populate the dropdown options dynamically, ensuring that only relevant expense names are displayed based on the selected category.

By including the "combobox" sheet in the screenshots, users can gain insights into the mechanism behind the userform's dependent dropdowns and better understand how the Expense Management System simplifies expense data entry through this intuitive feature.

**Data Source - Dataset Breakdown:**
The Dataset Breakdown provides an overview of the synthesized data used in the project. It ensures that the data does not capture any financial or sensitive company information. The dataset consists of 1849 rows and 9 columns, including fields such as S/N (Integer), Amount (Currency), Date (Date format), and others (Text data types). The breakdown serves as a reference for understanding the data's structure and characteristics.
