## Overview

The Expense Management System is a VBA Excel-based project designed to provide organizations with an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing expenses. The system allows users to enter, track, and analyze expenses through a custom userform and real-time analytics dashboard. It also offers the capability to import expense records from other spreadsheets and provides extensive data visualization for better decision-making.

## Features

1. **Userform Entry:** The system features a user-friendly userform that enables users to input expense details, such as date, category, expense name, amount, location, comments, and more.

2. **Real-Time Dashboard:** The analytics dashboard presents key insights into expense data using various charts and visualizations, including donut charts, line charts, waterfall charts, and battery charts, providing a comprehensive overview of expenses.

3. **Pivot Tables and Power Query:** The project utilizes Power Pivot and Power Query to create data models, relationships, and perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) for in-depth expense analysis.

4. **Dependent Dropdowns:** The userform features dependent dropdowns, enabling users to select expense names based on the chosen category, ensuring accurate and relevant expense entries.

5. **Data Import and Export:** The system supports importing expenses from other spreadsheets, and users can export data to different formats, such as CSV, for seamless sharing and analysis.

6. **Security and Admin Privileges:** A System Admin section provides options to change passwords, set user permissions, and manage system settings, ensuring data security and user management.

7. **Cloud-Based Database (Future Enhancement):** The project has a vision for future improvements, including transitioning the database to a cloud-based solution, allowing real-time collaboration and simultaneous entry of expenses by multiple users.
