## Expense Analysis

### Overall Expense Trends

The line chart depicting the overall expense trends reveals fluctuations in expenses over time. Notably, there is an 18% increase in total expenses compared to the previous year. This suggests a potential need for cost optimization strategies.

### Expense Distribution by Category

The donut chart showcases the distribution of expenses across various categories. The highest expense category is "Monthly Salary," followed by expenses incurred by the "Director." These two categories account for a significant portion of the organization's expenses. Further analysis of the "Director" expenses is recommended to understand the specific nature of these costs.

### Top 5 Recurring Expenses

The waterfall chart highlights the top 5 recurring expenses by category. Lubricant & Fuel, Purchases, Repairs & Maintenance, Directors Expense, and Monthly Salary are the most significant recurring expenses. Effective cost management measures can be implemented by focusing on these areas.

### Non-Organizational Expenses

The non-organizational expenses chart reveals expenses that do not directly contribute to the organization's operations. These expenses, such as "Directors House" and "Requested by Director," should be closely monitored to ensure they align with the organization's goals and objectives.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis and insights gained from the visualizations, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. **Cost Optimization**: The organization should consider implementing cost optimization strategies to address the 18% increase in total expenses.

2. **Director Expenses**: A deeper investigation into the "Director" expenses is essential to ensure transparency and better understand the nature of these costs.

3. **Focus on Top Expenses**: Since "Monthly Salary" and "Directors Expense" are the highest expense categories, reviewing and optimizing costs related to staff salaries and directors' activities can yield significant cost savings.

4. **Non-Organizational Expenses**: Non-organizational expenses that do not contribute directly to the organization's operations should be carefully evaluated and minimized when possible.

5. **Regular Data Analysis**: Regular analysis of expense data is crucial for detecting patterns, trends, and areas for improvement. Implementing a system that facilitates continuous data analysis is recommended.

6. **Centralized Expense Tracking**: Considering the benefits of the Expense Management System developed, it is advised to centralize expense tracking to prevent repetitive entries and provide real-time analytics to senior management.
