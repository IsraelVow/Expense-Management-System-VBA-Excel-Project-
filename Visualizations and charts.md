As a professional data analyst owning this project, I would display the visualizations and charts page within my GitHub repository in an organized and visually appealing manner. Here's how I would structure and present the page:

# Visualizations and Charts

This section showcases the various visualizations and charts generated from the Expense Management System dataset. The visualizations provide valuable insights into the organization's expenses, trends, and patterns.

## Dashboard

The dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of key expense metrics and trends. It includes the following visualizations:

### Overall Expense Trend

A line chart displaying the overall expense trend over time. This chart helps identify any significant fluctuations or patterns in expenses.

### Total Expense Overview

A battery chart presenting the total percentage of expenses. The chart can be sliced to reveal the percentage of each expense category against the total expense.

## Pivot Table Analysis

The pivot table provides a detailed analysis of expenses by category and expense name. It summarizes the total amount spent in each category and expense name, facilitating better decision-making.

## Additional Insights

Apart from the visualizations presented above, the project also includes interactive pivot charts, bar charts, and pie charts. These visualizations allow users to perform ad-hoc analysis and gain deeper insights into specific expense categories and trends.

## Data Source

The visualizations and charts are generated from the Expense Management System dataset, which can be accessed from the [Data Source](https://github.com/IsraelVow/Expense-Management-System-VBA-Excel-Project-/raw/main/Dataset.xlsx).

In this structure, I provide a clear heading for the visualizations and charts section. Each visualization is presented with a relevant image and a brief description of its purpose and insights. I also mention the data source used for generating the visualizations and invite users to access it for further exploration. The "Additional Insights" section indicates that there are more visualizations available for ad-hoc analysis, leaving room for users to explore and interact with the data further. Finally, I include a short authorship section with links to my GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile for further engagement.
