Created a userform to Track data

Created a Dashboard for the boss 
(the search and filter button on the userform doesnt work in the dashboard sheet 
because the record in the database were an upload from power query instead of using the userform
so 2019 was initially uploaded, 2020 till 2021 feb is being extracted to be updated manually on the database sheet for
visualization, 
the 2020-2021feb file is currently in (All almadina expense folder), in the event of new record to be updated
you will convert the data in the new gotten file from manager as an excel table but
ensure to change the file name in other for power query to read and automate, 
hopefully it ll automatically run the queries initially ran to ETL, 
 
Calendar Table Generated by power pivot will not update based on the existing record, it will only collect the dates
of the recently pasted record so a new date table must be created,followed by creating a relationship on the
Ftransaction
the name of the new calendar that has the updated dates will not update the Dax formulars so you must edit them all
